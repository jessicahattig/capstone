### Meetings Notes: Meeting with Michael 2/2/24 2:00 pm - 2:41 pm.
Michael met with the committee again last week. The board oversees the Parks and Rec district, but we aren't collectively engaged in promoting this ballot. While the focus is on the ballot measure, the board itself cannot actively promote it. However, individuals are encouraged to promote it on their own.

#### Information on the May '24 Ballot Measure

Voted on but they are in the middle on getting the ballot measure together regarding wording and explanations for a ballot out to vote.
Using volunteers like themselves - they have a PAC (political action compitee) which can promote ballot and can work individual as board members but not as acomittee. Board meetings can work one on oenwith individuals. Michael is working on social media and the web pag. I can work wiith others on the comittee, as individual, There is 3.5 months to vote. Michael wants the bear bones of the website. Mid february would be great to start sending them to. Michael wil be the milddle person to add additional information or adjustments on the website.
